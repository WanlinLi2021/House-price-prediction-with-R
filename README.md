This project covers the linear regression model. It allows us to assess the relationship between variables in a data set and a continuous response variable.

The project consists of three parts: 
1. The initial part will concern exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Ames Housing dataset. 
2. The second part will discuess model assumptions, selection, and interpretation. 
3. The final part will deal with model validation and out-of-sample prediction.
